# CMSC-626-PCS-DFS

# Architecture of Distributed File System
1. This setup consists of 3 Storage Servers namely(ServerA, ServerB, and ServerC)
2. It also consists of a Master Server that processes all requests.
3. It serves multiple instances of clients.

# Code changes to be made before running the code
1. In each storage server file(ServerA, ServerB and ServerC), replace the path "path = 'C:/Users/samso/OneDrive/Desktop/ALL_DOCS/UMBC/PCS/Trial3'" with the current file location.
2. Make note of the ports being used in each file (Eg: ServerA.py - Port = 54321) and make sure they match Line 13 in Master.py(Storageport_A = [54321, 64321, 1237]). (if the Storage server ports are changed, change them in master.py respectively)
3. Make sure that the port on the Client.py and the Master.py are the same.
4. If you are deploying the storage servers and the master on different systems, make sure that you change Line 9 in Master.py(StorageServer = '0.0.0.0') to whatever the IPv4 address of the system running the storage servers(ServerA, ServerB and ServerC).
5. In test_watch first change the path for the storage servers A and the second file will be the path where the "filelist.txt" is located
6. The third path in the test_watch will be changed to the location where the entire project is located, as we need to monitor whole system for malicious activities.

# Deploying the code
1. To run the system, run the following commands on multiple commands prompts from the respective file directories.
2. To run ServerA, open the command prompt in the file directory containing ServerA.py and execute 'python ServerA.py'
3. Similarly, run 'python ServerB.py' and 'python ServerC.py' in their respective command prompts.
4. To run the master, open the command prompt in the file directory containing Master.py and execute 'python Master.py'
5. Once these files are running, Client.py can be run by executing 'python Client.py'
6. After the client is connected run the test_watch.py which will enable the watch.
